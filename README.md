# minik

GitHub kanban boards but tiny. Like really tiny.

## What is this

A native app that shows your GitHub project boards in a minimalist floating window. Think macOS Stickies but for GitHub projects. Built with Tauri because why not.

## Status

ðŸ”¥ **Extremely broken and experimental** ðŸ”¥

This barely works. Sometimes it doesn't. Features are half-implemented or completely missing. The code is a mess. You've been warned.

## Building

Assuming you're brave enough:

```bash
cargo install tauri-cli
cargo tauri dev
```

## Why "minik"

It's supposed to be mini. The k is for kanban. Or maybe I just can't spell.

## Contributing

Don't. Seriously, wait until this actually does something useful first.

## License

MIT (but honestly there's nothing worth licensing yet)
